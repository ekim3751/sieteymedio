# sieteymedio
.h and .cpp files for a card game, "siete y medio", simulation. The goal of this repo is to demonstrate an ability to use version control software. The simulation includes an automated dealer and the user as the player. Each round information is output to gamelog.txt.

Note: one of the first commit comments noted that I "defined" functions in the .h file, but instead it should have read "declared".
